XenAPI Software Development Kit
===============================

This repository contains the generation code for the XenAPI Software Development
Kit (SDK) and its associated documentation and examples.

The SDK consists of five components, one for each of C, C#, Java, PowerShell,
and Python, exposing the individual XenAPI calls as first-class functions in the
target language.

The generation code is mostly written in [Ocaml][1] 3.12.

Build
-----

#### 1. Environment setup

Install [opam][2]. It is also recommended to install one of the listed external
solvers (e.g. aspcud).

Ensure you are using version 4.02.3 of the Ocaml compiler:
`opam switch 4.02.3`

and you have the package depext: `opam install depext`

_Note: if you want to avoid setting up the environment by yourself, you can use
one of the ready containers from [opam-dockerfiles][3], which come with a
preinstalled OPAM environment and Ocaml compiler._

#### 2. Install dependencies

Add [xs-opam][4] as a remote Opam repository (follow the instructions in that
repo).

Then, to install the dependencies of the SDK, which include Xapi, run

```
   opam depext -y xen-api-sdk
   opam install -y --deps-only xen-api-sdk
```
This will install first the external dependencies of this package and of all
its dependencies, and then all the OPAM packages required for building it.

Finally, copy [this file][5] into the root of the xen-api-sdk repo.

#### 3. SDK generation

Run `make <lang>`, where `<lang>` one or more of `c`, `java`, `csharp`,
`powershell`, to generate SDK source code for the specified programming
language(s), or simply `make` to generate SDK source code for all the supported
languages.

To compile the generated source code, follow the instructions in the corresponding
README files.

_Note: The Python module is not auto-generated. It can be found at
[XenAPI.py][6]._

Contributions
-------------

The preferable way to contribute patches is to fork the repository on Github
and then submit a pull request. If for some reason you can't use Github to
submit a pull request, then you may send your patch for review to the
<xen-api@lists.xen.org> mailing list, with a link to a public git
repository for review. Please see the CONTRIB.md file for some general
guidelines on submitting changes.
