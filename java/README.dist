XenServerJava
=============

Version @SDK_VERSION@

XenServerJava is a complete SDK for Citrix Hypervisor, exposing the Citrix
Hypervisor API as Java classes.

It is available in the CitrixHypervisor-SDK-@SDK_VERSION@.zip, which can be downloaded
from https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-hypervisor/.

For Citrix Hypervisor documentation see https://docs.citrix.com.
XenServerJava includes a class for every API class, and a method for each API
call, so API documentation and examples written for other languages will apply
equally well to Java. In particular, the SDK Guide and the Management API Guide
are ideal for developers wishing to use XenServerJava.

Compiling from source
---------------------

Extract XenServerJava from CitrixHypervisor-SDK-@SDK_VERSION@.zip.
Copy the dependency jars from XenServerJava/bin to XenServerJava/src.

From XenServerJava/src do:
- "make all" to build the XenServer binary
- "make docs" to build the documentation.

To build and run the tests, copy them from XenServerJava/samples to
XenServerJava/src, then from XenServerJava/src "make all" and

$ CLS_PATH=:xmlrpc-client-3.1.3.jar:xmlrpc-common-3.1.3.jar:ws-commons-util-1.0.2.jar
$ java -cp $CLS_PATH RunTests <host> <username> <password> [nfs server] [nfs path]
