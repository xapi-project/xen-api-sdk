XenServerJava
=============

XenServerJava is a complete SDK for Citrix Hypervisor, exposing the Citrix
Hypervisor API as Java classes.

XenServerJava includes a class for every API class, and a method for each API
call, so API documentation and examples written for other languages will apply
equally well to Java. In particular, the SDK Guide and the Management API Guide
are ideal for developers wishing to use XenServerJava.

XenServerJava is free software. You can redistribute and modify it under the
terms of the BSD 2-Clause license. See LICENSE.txt for details.

This library is accompanied a number of test programs that can be used ass
pedagogical examples. These do not form part of this library, and are licensed for
redistribution and modification under the BSD 2-Clause license.

Compiling from source
---------------------

Extract the contents of this archive,
Copy the dependency jars from XenServerJava/bin to XenServerJava/src.

From XenServerJava/src do:
- "make all" to build the XenServer binary
- "make docs" to build the documentation.

To build and run the tests, copy them from XenServerJava/samples to
XenServerJava/src, then from XenServerJava/src "make all" and

$ CLS_PATH=:xmlrpc-client-3.1.3.jar:xmlrpc-common-3.1.3.jar:ws-commons-util-1.0.2.jar
$ java -cp $CLS_PATH RunTests <host> <username> <password> [nfs server] [nfs path]
