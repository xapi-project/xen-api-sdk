XenServerJava
=============

XenServerJava is a complete SDK for Citrix Hypervisor, exposing the Citrix
Hypervisor API as Java classes.

XenServerJava includes a class for every API class, and a method for each API
call, so API documentation and examples written for other languages will apply
equally well to Java. In particular, the SDK Guide and the Management API Guide
are ideal for developers wishing to use XenServerJava.

XenServerJava is free software. You can redistribute and modify it under the
terms of the BSD 2-Clause license. See LICENSE for details.

This library is accompanied by a number of test programs that can be used as
pedagogical examples. These are shipped as a separate package
(com.citrix.hypervisor.xen-api-samples) and are licensed for redistribution and
modification under the BSD 2-Clause license.
