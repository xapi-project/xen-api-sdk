XenServer.NET
=============

Version @SDK_VERSION@

XenServer.NET is a complete SDK for Citrix Hypervisor, exposing the Citrix
Hypervisor API as .NET classes. It is written in C#.

It is available in the CitrixHypervisor-SDK-@SDK_VERSION@.zip, which can be downloaded
from https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-hypervisor/.

For Citrix Hypervisor documentation, see https://docs.citrix.com.
XenServer.NET includes a class for every API class, and a method for each API
call, so API documentation and examples written for other languages will apply
equally well to .NET. In particular, the SDK Guide and the Management API Guide
are ideal for developers wishing to use XenServer.NET.

- XenServer.NET\samples: contains the examples shipped as a Visual studio solution.


Getting Started
---------------

Download and unzip the CitrixHypervisor-SDK-@SDK_VERSION@.zip.

A. To use the compiled binaries in your code:
  1.  Copy both XenServer.dll and CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll from the bin folder
      into your own workspace.
  2.  In Visual Studio, add references to both DLLs from your own program.
      Project > Add Reference > Browse.
  3.  You should now be ready to compile against XenServer.NET.

B. To build the source code:
  1. Copy CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll from the bin folder into the source code
     folder at the same level as the XenServer.csproj file.
  2. Open the project XenServer.csproj in Visual Studio.
  3. You should now be ready to build the source code.

C. To run the examples:
  1. Copy XenServer.dll, CookComputing.XmlRpcV2.dll, and Newtonsoft.Json.dll
     from the bin folder into the samples folder at the same level as the
     XenSdkSample.csproj file.
  2. Open XenSdkSample.sln inside Visual Studio (2013 or greater).
  3. You should now be ready to compile the solution and run the examples.
     The solution project is a console application expecting the parameters
     <host> <username> <password> to be passed to its Main method.
